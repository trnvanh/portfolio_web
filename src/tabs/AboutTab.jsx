      <h2>Hi, I'm Anh Tran!</h2>
      <p>
        A second year Master's student at Tampere University, Finland. My major is Software, Devs and Cloud. 
        I actually studied a Bachelor's in chemical engineering, with minor in ICT. After graduation, I decided 
        to continue studying a Master's in Computer Science. I was qualified to do steer the wheel, and I really 
        wanted to study about Comp Sci, even though it was a completely different field compared to chemistry.

        I always love to build things. If there's a dish that I want to cook, and I don't know how, I research, 
        gather all the required ingredients, and learn how to cook it. My skillset ranges from UI/UX design, 
        frontend/backend developing to DevOps, data.

        I believe that a good software can do good to people. And sustainability is as important as profit. It 
        shouldn't be a tradeoff when developing a software, or anything nowadays.
