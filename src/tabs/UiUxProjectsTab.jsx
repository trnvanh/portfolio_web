                `A Web-Based Platform for reducing plastic use and promoting sustainable practices among university students. 
                This is the project in the scope of course HTI.100 User Interfaces and Human-Centred Design of professor Jari Varsaluoma at Tampere University, 
                which is one of the best courses I have taken. The team was 3 students: me, My, and Sang. We conducted user research, interviewed participants; 
                defined context of use, users and built personas; defined user tasks, goals and usability goals; moved on to concept map, conceptual design, made 
                user scenarios with story boards; designed wireframes, low-fi prototype, then hi-fi and interactive prototype using Figma. We wrote a report of 51 pages 
                to describe workflow, schedule, and explain everything that we did, why and how we made decisions. I learned so much from doing this project!`,
